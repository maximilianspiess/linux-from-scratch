# Linux from Scratch

This is a shared repository between [Etienne Bratschi](https://github.com/etieskrill) and [Maximilian Spiess](https://github.com/maximilianspiess). The goal is to follow the
[Linux from Scratch Book](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/) and to build a Linux. By doing this, we hope to learn the intricacies of building an OS and acquiring a better knowledge of how Linux works.

Within the `docs` folder is the `knowledge.md` document. In it, all important concepts and information about building the Linux OS and topics around it are written down. In the same folder you can find the `timeline.md` document. Documented in it are all taken and to be taken steps of the project. We use this to keep track of deadlines.
