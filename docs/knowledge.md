## Summaries

### Tarred software packages

Linux source software packages most often come in an **archived** (*tarred*) and **compressed** (*gzipped*) format, the file extension being .tar.gz or .tgz, which in the jargon is known as a "tarball". Depending on the compression algorithm used, the final section of the file extension may differ. Most any of these packages can be unpacked using

> `tar tzvf <filename>`
